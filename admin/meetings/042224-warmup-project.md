**Notes** <!---Things to keep in mind for the future, such as due dates-->
- Warmup Project is due Friday 
- Backend team will read the JSON and Frontend will display it
- No singular person will do much of the work
- Documentation should be rigorous as the process is more important than the product

**Events** <!---Important things that happened or were decided-->

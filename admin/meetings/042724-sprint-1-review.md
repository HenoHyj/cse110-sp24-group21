Present: Avighna, Peter, Kane, Yuehua, Luca, Diego, Sierra, Stefan

**Notes** <!---Things to keep in mind for the future, such as due dates-->
- Yuehua worked on the display function, which displays tasks read from json
- Avighna worked on the import data function, whichs reads the json file and performs checks (a lot of verification to check the format)
  - helped with the sorting code for the dates
  - created test jsons
- Peter worked on documentation and frontend, wrote some backend, implemented the UI -> light/dark mode
- Sierra worked on the strikethrough function, which strikes through text when checkbox is toggled -> first javascript experience
- Stefan worked on the toggle icon function, which expands/collapses tasks, some backend documentation
- Kane set up CSS and HTML, helped cleaned up frontend code, as well as responsiveness with keyboard
  - helped fixed the resizing problem when window size changes
  - wants to improve on adding test cases
- Diego worked on the footer HTML and CSS, coordination with frontend and issues
- Luca created UI design, worked on HTML structure and commenting, some CSS for light/dark mode
  - got arrow assets along with Kane

**Stuff to improve**
- making sure merge conflicts don't happen
- more test cases
- maybe separate large functions into different scripts
- maybe start incorporating Github actions

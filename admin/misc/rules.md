# Team 21 Contract
## Primary means of communication
We will communicate primarily on Slack (checking at least once per day, notifications on), and have a mix of hybrid and in-person meeting. Expected response time is 24 hours, and team members are expected to react to important messages upon reading them.
## Scheduling Meetings
Weekly overall group meetings will be held Friday 5-7pm at the CSE basement unless decided otherwise. Impromptu meetings will be held on Zoom, scheduled via when2meet. Subgroup meetings will be arranged by the group members. Members should plan to arrive 5-10 minutes early (and keep that in mind when deciding availability), and be at most 5 minutes late to all meetings.
## General Responsibilities and Expectations for All Team Members
- All members should do their best to equalize the amount of work that we do (e.g. nobody should try to do too much or too little work)
- All members should document their code; every function should have a description (input, output, general function) and classes should have short descriptions for each member variable. Nontrivial optimizations should be explained.
  - Commit messages should be readable and descriptive.
- All members should do their best to contribute to an open and inclusive environment.
- Take ownership of your own code. If LLMs are used, be sure to verify the correctness of the code generated.
- If a member misses a meeting, it is their responsibility to read the meeting notes and catch up on what was missed.
  - All meetings should have meeting minutes documented.
## Conflict Resolution
- If a conflict occurs between members, start by DMing on Slack or approaching one of the team leads.
- Be respectful and understanding.
- If a team member is behind on their work, then a meeting with the relevant people will be arranged to address the situation.
## Expectations of Faculty and TAs
- If an issue arises between a team member and a team lead, it may be escalated to the other team lead/a TA or the professor.
- If there is an issue that cannot be resolved by the team itself, the team will reach out to the course staff.

## The Team
Hi! We're Team **9+10==21**! 

![Our Team](/admin/src/team.png)

We're a diverse group of 11 sophomores and juniors who will overtake the tech industry.

## Team Values
Below are the team values we have decided to abide by throughout this quarter:

> Talk

We want to make sure that we are able to communicate any of our ideas both effectively and in a manner inclusive of everyone.
> Growth Mindset

We want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to learn something new and grow our skills as aspiring software engineers.
> Psychological Safety

Be like Gordon Ramsey. But also don't be as mad as him.
> Don't Overstress

The project is a shared responsibility; by delegating work appropriately we'll ensure that no one is overworked, and that we will be able to complete the project in a timely manner (hopefully without having to stress out too much).
> Have Fun!

Building software is supposed to be fun (or at least we think so)! We'll try to enjoy the process, including all the highs and lows we'll face. Hopefully more highs than lows though.
## Team Brand
Our team brand is that we're **underdogs**. This ties closely into one of our values of maintaining a persistent growth mindset! Although we may not have as much industry experience compared to some of the other groups out there, all 12 of us are eager to learn something new and contribute towards this project.

Our team color is a combination of Green and Lavendar (voted by democracy). We sure are confident that with our teamwork, we can produce an app that would revolutionize the tech industry! (or so we believe).

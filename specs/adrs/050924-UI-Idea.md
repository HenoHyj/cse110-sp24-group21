# The decision regarding the UI layout and design

## Context and Problem Statement

Before diving into coding the initial HTML structure, we need to establish the general UI design. Since there are various UI design concepts to consider, we have to compare their pros and cons to determine the most suitable one for our project.

<!-- {Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story.
 You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.} -->

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
<!-- ## Decision Drivers

* {decision driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …}
* {decision driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …} -->
<!-- * … numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Canvas looking layout. (the color theme can later be decided)

* Option 2: Informative Layout.

* Option 3: Simple Layout.

<!-- * … numbers of options can vary -->


<!-- {justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | … | comes out best (see below)}. -->

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
<!-- ### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
* … numbers of consequences can vary -->

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
<!-- ## Validation

{describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR is validated. E.g., by a review or an ArchUnit test} -->

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Canvas Layout

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
<!-- {example | description | pointer to more information | …} -->

* Good, because Canvas would be a good reference for us to do the initial design without us having to consider details.
* Good, because the template fits our idea so far.
<!-- use "neutral" if the given argument weights neither for good nor bad -->
* Neutral, because it looks nice.
* Bad, because we could be limited to the layout, and there should be more function in our project.
<!-- * … numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### Informative Layout

* Good, because the user can easily find the information they want to review immediately
* Neutral, because we have to consider the position of each element.
* Bad, because if the entity gets too much, the page would looks messy.
<!-- * … -->

### Simple Layout

* Good, because it looks clean and intuitive.
* Good, because it can only display the important information on the main page as some other information is able to be displayed by the sidebar button.
* Good, because it can add/view the journal easily from the main page.
* Neutral, because the HTML and CSS implementation can be not too complicated.
* Bad, because other functions are in the sidebar button, first-time users could be confused.
<!-- * … -->
